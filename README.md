Fast-Ansible: Ansible Tutorial, Sample Usage Scenarios (Howto: Hands-on LAB)
I want to share the Ansible tutorial, cheat sheet, and usage scenarios that I created as a notebook for myself. I know that Ansible is a detailed topic to learn in a short term, so I gathered useful information and create sample general usage scenarios of Ansible.

This repo covers Ansible with HowTo: Hands-on LABs (using Multipass: Ubuntu Lightweight VMs): Ad-Hoc Commands, Modules, Playbooks, Tags, Managing Files and Servers, Users, Roles, Handlers, Host Variables, Templates, and many details. Possible usage scenarios are aimed to update over time.
